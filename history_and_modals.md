## The problem

Various UI components have a "modal" or "popup" behavior. For example:

- a `<dialog>` element, especially the [`showModal()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal);
- a sidebar menu;
- a lightbox;
- a custom picker input (e.g. date picker);
- a custom context menu;
- fullscreen mode.

An important common feature of these components is that they are designed to be easy to close, with a uniform interaction mechanism for doing so. Typically, this is the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key on desktop platforms, and the back button on some mobile platforms (notably Android). Game consoles also tend to use a specific button as their "close/cancel/back" button. Finally, accessibility technology sometimes provides specific close signals for their users, e.g. iOS VoiceOver's "dismiss an alert or return to the previous screen" [gesture](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/learn-voiceover-gestures-iph3e2e2281/ios#:~:text=Dismiss%20an%20alert%20or%20return%20to%20the%20previous%20screen).

We define a **cancel signal** as a _platform-mediated_ interaction that's intended to close an in-page component. This is distinct from _page-mediated_ interactions, such as clicking on an "x" or "Done" button, or clicking on the backdrop outside of the modal.

Currently, web developers have no good way to handle these close signals. This is especially problematic on Android devices, where the back button is the traditional close signal. Imagine a user filling in a twenty-field form, with the last item being a custom date picker modal. The user might click the back button hoping to close the date picker, like they would in a native app. But instead, the back button navigates the web page's history tree, likely closing the whole form and losing the filled information. But the problem of how to handle close signals extends across all operating systems; implementing a good experience for users of different browsers, platforms, and accessibility technologies requires a lot of user agent sniffing today.

This explainer proposes a new API to enable web developers, especially component authors, to better handle these close signals.

## Goals

Our primary goals are as follows:

- Allow web developers to intercept close signals (e.g. <kbd>Esc</kbd> on desktop, back button on Android, "z" gesture on iOS using VoiceOver) to close custom components that they create.

- Discourage platform-specific code for handling modal close signals, by providing an API that abstracts away the differences.

- Allow future platforms to introduce new close signals (e.g., a "swipe away" gesture), such that code written against the API proposed here automatically works on such platforms.

- Allow the developer to confirm a close signal, in a similar fashion to `beforeunload`, to avoid potential data loss.

- Prevent abuse that traps the user on a given history state by disabling the back button's ability to actually navigate backward in history.

- Be usable by component authors, in particular by avoiding any global state modifications that might interfere with the app or with other components.

- Specify uniform-per-platform behavior across existing platform-provided components, e.g. `<dialog>`, `<input>` pickers, and fullscreen. (For example: currently the back button on Android does not close modal `<dialog>`s, but instead navigates history. It does close `<input>` pickers and close fullscreen.)

- Explain `<dialog>`'s existing `close` and `cancel` events in terms of this model.

The following is a goal we wish we could meet, but don't believe is possible to meet while also achieving our primary goals:

- Avoid an awkward transition period, where the Android back button closes components on sites that adopt this new API, but navigates history on sites that haven't adopted it. In particular, right now users generally know the Android back button fails to close modals in web apps and avoid it when modals are open; we worry about this API causing a state where users are no longer sure which action it performs.

## What developers are doing today

On desktop platforms, this problem is currently solved by listening for the `keydown` event, and closing the component when the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is pressed. Built-in platform APIs, such as [`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal), [fullscreen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API), or [`<input type="date">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date), will do this automatically. Note that this can be easy to get wrong, e.g. by accidentally listening for `keyup` or `keypress`.

On mobile platforms, getting the right behavior is significantly harder. First, platform-specific code is required, to do nothing on iOS and to capture the back button on Android. Next, capturing the back button on Android requires manipulating the history stack using the [history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). This is a poor fit for several reasons:

- This UI state is non-navigational, i.e., the URL doesn't and shouldn't change when opening a component. When the page is reloaded or shared, web developers generally don't want to automatically re-open the same component.

- It's very hard to determine when the component's state is popped out of history, because both moving forward and backward through history emit the same `popstate` event, and that event can be emitted for history navigation that traverses more than one entry at a time.

- The `history.state` API, used to store the component's state, is rather fragile: user-initiated fragment navigation, as well as other calls to `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()`, can override it.

- History navigation is not cancelable. Implementing "Are you sure you want to close this dialog without saving?" requires letting the history navigation complete, then potentially re-establishing the dialog's state if the user declines to close the dialog.

- A shared component that attempts to use the history API to implement these techniques can easily corrupt a web application's router.

## Proposal

The proposal is to introduce a new API, the `CloseWatcher` class, which has the following basic API:

```js
// Note: constructor could throw a "NotAllowedError" DOMException, if used too
// many times without user interaction.
const watcher = new CloseWatcher();

// This fires when the user sends a close signal, e.g. by pressing Esc on
// desktop or by pressing Android's back button.
watcher.onclose = () => {
  myModal.close();
};

// You should destroy watchers which are no longer needed, e.g. if the
// modal closes normally. This will prevent future events on this watcher.
myModalCloseButton.onclick = () => {
  watcher.destroy();
  myModal.close();
};
```

If more than one `CloseWatcher` is active at a given time, then only the most-recently-constructed one gets events delivered to it. A watcher becomes inactive after a `close` event is delivered, or the watcher is explicitly `destroy()`ed.

Read on for more details and realistic usage examples.

### Asking for confirmation

There's a more advanced part of this API, which allows asking the user for confirmation if they really want to close the modal. This is useful in cases where, e.g., the modal contains a form with unsaved data. The usage looks like the following:

```js
watcher.oncancel = e => {
  if (hasUnsavedData) {
    e.preventDefault();
  }
};
```

_Note: the name of this event, i.e. `cancel` instead of something like `beforeclose`, is chosen to match `<dialog>`, which has the same two-tier `cancel` + `close` event sequence._

If the event is canceled via `preventDefault()`, then the browser will show some UI saying something like "Close modal? Changes you made may not be saved." For [abuse prevention](#abuse-analysis), this text is _not_ configurable.

Furthermore, unlike `Window`'s `beforeunload` event, this browser UI does _not_ block the event loop. Instead, it simply has the effect of delaying the `close` event until the user says "Yes".

If the user says "No" (i.e., keep the component open), then the `CloseWatcher` remains active, and can receive future `cancel` (and `close`) events. But once the user says "Yes" (i.e., confirms closing the component), the `CloseWatcher` receives the final `close` event, and becomes inactive.

The exact UI for this confirmation is up to the user agent. It could be a `beforeunload`-style modal dialog, but the resulting "modal on top of a modal" might be ugly. _TODO maybe we can get some mock-ups of better ideas._

Note that the `cancel` event is not fired when the user navigates away from the page: i.e., it has no overlap with `beforeunload`. `beforeunload` remains the best way to confirm a page unload, with `cancel` only used for confirming a close signal.

### User activation gating

It was mentioned above that the `new CloseWatcher()` constructor can throw if called too many times without user activation. Specifically, the design is that the page gets one "free" active `CloseWatcher` at a time. After that, any further `CloseWatcher` constructions require [transient activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation-gated-api), i.e., the construction must happen as part of or shortly after a user interaction event like `click`, `pointerup`, or `keydown`.

The motivation for this is that, for platforms like Android where the modal close gesture is to use the back button, we need to prevent abuse that traps the user on a page by effectively disabling their back button. This restriction means that the back button can only be intercepted as many times as user activation was given to the document, plus one.

The allowance for a single non-activation-triggered `CloseWatcher` is to allow use cases like "session inactivity timeout" modals, or high-priority interrupt popups. The page can create a single one of these at a given time, which we believe strikes a good balance between meeting realistic use cases and preventing abuse.

Note that for developers, this means that calling `watcher.destroy()` properly is important, as doing so will free up the "free `CloseWatcher` slot", if it has been previously consumed.

### Signaling close yourself

The API has an additional convenience method, `watcher.signalClosed()`, which acts _as if_ a close signal had been sent by the user. The intended use case is to allow centralizing close-handling code. So the above example of

```js
watcher.onclose = () => myModal.close();

myModalCloseButton.onclick = () => {
  watcher.destroy();
  myModal.close();
};
```

could be replaced by

```js
watcher.onclose = () => myModal.close();

myModalCloseButton.onclick = () => watcher.signalClosed();
```

deduplicating the `myModal.close()` call by having the developer put all their close-handling logic into the watcher's `close` event handler.

If called from within [transient user activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation-gated-api), `signalClosed()` also invokes `cancel` event handlers, and will potentially cause a confirmation UI to come up which could delay the `close` event. If called without user activation, then it skips straight to the `close` event.

In either case, as usual, reaching the `close` event will inactivate the `CloseWatcher`, meaning it receives no further events in the future and it no longer occupies the "free `CloseWatcher` slot", if it was previously doing so.

### Platform implementation notes

#### Android: interaction with fragment navigation

Consider a popup which contains a lot of text, such as a terms of service with a table of contents, or a preview overlay that shows an interactive version of this very document. Within such a popup, it'd be possible to perform fragment navigation. Although these situations are hopefully rare in practice, we need to figure out how they impact the proposed API.

In particular, the problem case is again Android, where the back button serves as both a potential close signal and a way of navigating the history stack. We suggest that for Android, the back button still acts as a close signal whenever any `CloseWatcher` is active. That is, it should only do fragment navigation back through the history stack when there are no active close watchers, even if fragment navigation has occurred since the popup was shown and the `CloseWatcher` was constructed.

This does mean that the popup could be closed, while the page's current fragment and its history stack still reflect fragment navigations that were performed inside the popup. The application would need to clean up such history entries to give a good user experience. We believe this is best done through a history-specific API, e.g. the existing `window.history` API or the proposed [app history API](https://github.com/WICG/app-history), since this sort of batching and reversion of history entries is a generic problem and not popup-specific.

The alternative is for implementations to treat back button presses as fragment navigations, only treating them as close signals once the user has returned to the same history entry as the popup was opened in. But discussion with framework authors indicated this would be harder to deal with and reason about. In particular, this would introduce significant divergences between platforms: on Android, closing a popup would not require any history-stack-cleaning, whereas on other platforms it would. So, in accordance with our [goal](#goals) of discouraging platform-specific code, we encourage implementations to go with the model suggested above, which enables web developers to use the same cleanup code without platform-specific branches. (Or they can avoid the problem altogether, by not providing opportunities for fragment navigation while popups are opened.)

#### iOS: VoiceOver and keyboard integration

iOS does not have a system-provided back button like Android does. But it still provides some close signals. In particular, [VoiceOver users have a specific gesture they can use](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/learn-voiceover-gestures-iph3e2e2281/ios#:~:text=Dismiss%20an%20alert%20or%20return%20to%20the%20previous%20screen), and iOS users who have connected a keyboard to their mobile device can use the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key (or [key combination](https://osxdaily.com/2019/04/12/how-type-escape-key-ipad/)).

Additionally, we note that the Apple Human Interface Guidelines [indicate](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/modality/) that a swipe-down gesture can be used to close certain types of modals. However, we suspect this would not be suitable for integration with `CloseWatcher`, since there's no guarantee that a `CloseWatcher` is being used for a sheet-type modal (as opposed to a fullscreen-type modal, or a non-modal control like a sidebar or picker). We'd welcome more thoughts from iOS experts.

### Abuse analysis

As discussed [above](#user-activation-gating), for platforms like Android where the modal close gesture is to use the back button, we need to prevent abuse that traps the user on a page by effectively disabling their back button. The user activation gating is intended to combat that. Notably, that protection is already stronger than anything done today for the `history.pushState()` API, which is another means by which apps can attempt to trap the user on the page. [See discussion below](#not-gating-on-transient-user-activation) for more on that.

Additionally, we note that in most back button UIs, the user always has an escape hatch of holding down the back button and explicitly choosing a history step to navigate back to. This is never a close signal.

Another potential abuse vector is the confirmation dialogs triggered by the `cancel` event. We saw much abuse of `Window`'s `beforeunload` event, during the era where it allowed user-provided strings (via `event.returnValue` or the event handler return value). The issue there is putting web-developer-supplied strings into trusted browser UI. Thus, we have designed this API to avoid this; the only action the web developer can take is the binary signal of either canceling the event, or letting it proceed.

### Realistic examples

The above sections give illustrative usage of the API. The following ones show how the API could be incorporated into realistic apps and UI components.

#### A sidebar

For a sidebar (e.g. behind a hamburger menu), which wants to hide itself on a user-provided close signal, that could be hooked up as follows:

```js
const hamburgerMenuButton = document.querySelector('#hamburger-menu-button');
const sidebar = document.querySelector('#sidebar');

hamburgerMenuButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const watcher = new CloseWatcher();

  sidebar.animate([{ transform: 'translateX(-200px)' }, { transform: 'translateX(0)' }]);

  watcher.onclose = () => {
    sidebar.animate([{ transform: 'translateX(0)' }, { transform: 'translateX(-200px)' }]);
  };

  // Close on clicks outside the sidebar.
  document.body.addEventListener('click', e => {
    if (e.target.closest('#sidebar') === null) {
      watcher.signalClosed();
    }
  });
});
```

#### A picker

For a "picker" control that wants to close itself on a user-provided close signal, code like the following would work:

```js
class MyPicker extends HTMLElement {
  #button;
  #overlay;
  #watcher;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.#button = /* ... */;

    this.#overlay = /* ... */;
    this.#overlay.hidden = true;
    this.#overlay.querySelector('.close-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.#watcher.close();
    });

    this.#button.onclick = () => {
      this.overlay.hidden = false;

      this.#watcher = new CloseWatcher();
      this.#watcher.onclose = () => this.overlay.hidden = true;
    }
  }
}
```

_TODO: include a React example._

#### A custom dialog

For a dialog, which might contain unsaved data, code like the following would work:

```js
class MyCustomDialog extends HTMLElement {
  #watcher;
  #hasUnsavedData;

  get hasUnsavedData() {
    return this.#hasUnsavedData;
  }
  set hasUnsavedData(v) {
    this.#hasUnsavedData = Boolean(v);
  }

  showModal() {
    // Normal dialog implementation left to the reader.

    this.#setupWatcherIfPossible();
    this.addEventListener('close', () => this.#watcher.?destroy());
  }

  close() {
    // Normal dialog implementation left to the reader.
    this.dispatchEvent(new Event('close'));
  }

  #setupWatcherIfPossible() {
    try {
      #watcher = new CloseWatcher();
    } catch {
      // The web developer using the component called showModal() outside of transient user activation.
      return;
    }

    #watcher.oncancel = e => {
      if (this.#hasUnsavedData) {
        e.preventDefault();
      }
    };

    #watcher.onclose = () => {
      this.close();
    };
  }
}
```

_TODO: include a React example._

## Existing platform close signals

With `CloseWatcher` as a foundation, we can work to unify the web platform's existing close signals:

### Extending `<dialog>`

`<dialog>` today is almost aligned with the `CloseWatcher` paradigm. That is, you can almost explain `<dialog>` in terms of it having an internal `CloseWatcher`, and re-exposing its functionality through the `<dialog>`'s `close` and `cancel` events, plus its `close()` method.

However, it departs in two ways:

- Existing `<dialog>` implementations do not treat the Android back button as a close signal. (Note: existing `<dialog>` implementations only exist on Android and on desktop platforms. On desktop platforms, they listen for the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key already.)
- Existing `<dialog>` implementations allow calling `e.preventDefault()` in the `<dialog>`'s `cancel` event an infinite number of times, without any user activation gating.

Our plan is to fix these departures from `CloseWatcher` behavior, so that `<dialog>` elements behave more like users expect in terms of being uniformly closeable with platform close signals. Specifically, the `cancel` event would only be fired (and thus cancelable) if the corresponding call to `dialogEl.showModal()` was done during user activation. And, the `<dialog>`s would potentially take up the "free `CloseWatcher` slot", i.e. you couldn't both pop up a `<dialog>` without user activation, and then construct a new `CloseWatcher` without user activation.

### Other existing close signals

The specification for `CloseWatcher` will have a specific definition for "close signal". Although the actual signal is implementation-defined and platform-dependent, having a definition gives us something we can reference to unify other specifications.

Specifically, we would update the following specifications:

- [Fullscreen](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#ui) would mention that a close signal should act as an instruction to the user agent to exit fullscreen
- [`<dialog>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#canceling-dialogs) would be updated as mentioned above
- Perhaps we'd update `<input>`'s specification as well to cover their picker UIs, but it is much more vague than the other two about UI

These updates would encourage user agents to make these built-in features behave the same as each other, and behave the same as `CloseWatcher`-based web-developer-created interfaces.

## Alternatives considered

### Integration with the history API

Because of how the back button on Android is a close signal, one might think it natural to make handling close signals part of either the existing history API, or a revised history API. This idea has some precedent in mobile application frameworks that integrate modals into their "back stack".

However, on the web the history API is intimately tied to navigations, the URL bar, and application state. Using it for UI state is generally not great. See also the [above discussion](#what-developers-are-doing-today) of how developers are forced to use the history API today for this purpose, and how poorly it works.

In fact, we're hopeful that by tackling this proposal separately from the history API, other efforts to improve the history API will be able to focus on actual navigations, instead of on close signals.

### Automatically translating all close signals to <kbd>Esc</kbd>

If we assume that developers already know to handle the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to close their components, then we could potentially translate other close signals, like the Android back button, into <kbd>Esc</kbd> key presses. The hope is then that application and component developers wouldn't have to update their code at all: if they're doing the right think for that common desktop close signal, they would suddenly start doing the right thing on other platforms as well. This is especially attractive as it could help avoid the awkward transition period mentioned in the [goals](#goals) section.

However, upon reflection, such a solution doesn't really solve the Android back button problem. Given an Android back button press, the browser needs to know: should this navigate history, or be translated to an <kbd>Esc</kbd> key press? For custom components, the only way to know is for the web developer to tell the browser that a close-signal-consuming component is open. So our goal of requiring no code modifications, or awkward transition period, is impossible. Given this, the strangeness of synthesizing fake <kbd>Esc</kbd> keypresses does not have much to recommend it.

### Not gating on transient user activation

We're gating the creation of more than one `CloseWatcher` on transient user activation as an [anti-abuse measure](#abuse-analysis). However, this protection is stronger than the existing protections against excessive `history.pushState()` use, which are are more vague and less mandatory in [that method's spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/history.html#dom-history-pushstate):

> Optionally, return. (For example, the user agent might disallow calls to these methods that are invoked on a timer, or from event listeners that are not triggered in response to a clear user action, or that are invoked in rapid succession.)

We could gate the creation of `CloseWatcher` on similarly-vague and optional protections. This would allow more free use of it, especially on platforms that don't use the back button as a close signal and so don't need the abuse protection.

But on balance, we'd prefer to start with the transient user activation restriction (plus one "free" `CloseWatcher`), mainly for reasons of interoperability. Allowing platforms to differ in when `CloseWatcher`s can be created would potentially create a race to the bottom, where nobody can be stricter than the most widely-used implementation.

### Bundling this with high-level APIs

The proposal here exposes `CloseWatcher` as a primitive. However, watching for close signals is only a small part of what makes UI components difficult. Some UI components that watch for close signals also need to deal with [top layer interaction](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4633), [blocking interaction with the main document](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/897) (including trapping focus within the component while it is open), providing appropriate accessibility semantics, and determining the appropriate screen position.

Instead of providing the individual building blocks for all of these pieces, it may be better to bundle them together into high-level semantic elements. We already have `<dialog>`; we could imagine others such as `<popup>`, `<toast>`, `<tooltip>`, `<sidebar>`, etc. These would then bundle the appropriate features, e.g. while all of them would benefit from top layer interaction, `<toast>` and `<tooltip>` do not need to handle close signals. One such proposal in this area is the [`<popup>` explainer](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/Popup/explainer.md).

Our current thinking is that we should produce both paths: we should work on bundled high-level APIs, such as the existing `<dialog>` and the upcoming `<popup>`, but we should also work on lower-level components, such as close signals or top layer management or focus trapping. And we should, as this document [tries to do](#existing-platform-close-signals), ensure these build on top of each other. This gives authors more flexibility for creating their own novel components, without waiting to convince implementers of the value of baking their high-level component into the platform, while still providing an evolutionary path for evolving the built-in control set over time.

## Security and privacy considerations

This feature has no security considerations to speak of, as a purely DOM API.

Regarding privacy, this proposal does not expose any information that was not already available via other means, such as `keydown` listeners.
